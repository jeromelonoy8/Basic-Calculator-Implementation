# Basic-Calculator-Implementation

Project description
Overview: This project aims to build a simple, interactive web application where user can add two numbers together. The application features a minimal design, responsive layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for functionality.

Learning experiences/challenges faced
The challenge I face is that I have limited knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I'm new to these programming languages. Therefore, I have to rely on searching online and watching YouTube videos to learn how to code and make my idea work in this simple project. For example, if you press Enter on your keyboard, it should add the numbers, or if you input a letter, an alert should say 'Please enter a number.
